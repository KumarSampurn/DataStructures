# DataStructures

## About

Hey there! This repository contains the code I wrote when i was learning data structures . I have tried to make the code as simple as possible so that it is easy to understand. I have also added comments wherever necessary.  

Suggestions and improvements are always welcome. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request.

I have tried to implement most of the ADT of the Data Strucutres. This project is still under development and I will be adding more stuff soon :smile: . Thanks to ChatGPT and Github Copilot becuase of these two i dont have to write lengthy boring main functions :smile: .
